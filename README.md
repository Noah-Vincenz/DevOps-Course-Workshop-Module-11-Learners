## My Notes

This project runs two hosted functions (FaaS) in the Azure Cloud platform. There is an endpoint listening to requests containing the following body:
```
{
    "subtitle": "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.",
    "languages": ["it", "de"]
}
```
The first function (located in HttpEndpoint) stores the input in the 'AcmeTranslations' table in the Azure cloud and sends a message to the 'acmesub-translations-queue' for each language element in the input list. The second function (located in TranslatorEndpoint) then processes each message by querying the corresponding entry in the 'AcmeTranslations' table, translating the input/subtitle in that table entry, and creating a new table entry with the translated output in the 'AcmeTranslations2' table in the Azure cloud.

To fetch changes from the remote cloud run the following:
```
func azure functionapp fetch-app-settings <APP_NAME>
```

To run a function locally run the following:
```
func start
```
inside the 'AcmeSubProject' directory.
